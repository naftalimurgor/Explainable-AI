# Machine Learning Basics

## 1. Core Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data (e.g., spam email detection).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards (e.g., game-playing AI).

## 2. Types of ML Algorithms
- **Regression** (Predict continuous values) → Example: Predicting house prices.
- **Classification** (Predict categories) → Example: Email spam detection.
- **Clustering** (Group similar data points) → Example: Customer segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction** (Reduce features) → Example: PCA for data compression.

## 3. Data Preparation
- **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant datasets.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming data features to improve performance.
- **Splitting Data**: Train-test-validation split (e.g., 70-20-10 rule).

## 4. Model Training & Evaluation
- **Training**: Feeding data to the model to learn patterns.
- **Loss Function**: Measures how well the model performs.
- **Optimization (Gradient Descent)**: Adjusting parameters to minimize errors.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
    - Accuracy, Precision, Recall (for classification)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) (for regression)
    - Confusion Matrix (for classification)

## 5. Common ML Libraries & Tools
- **Python Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding
- **Google Colab**: Free cloud-based GPU for training models

## 6. Overfitting & Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: The model memorizes training data but performs poorly on new data.
- **Underfitting**: The model is too simple and fails to capture patterns.

## 7. Model Deployment
- Converting trained models into APIs or integrating them into applications.
